Mutua General Purpose Peer-to-Peer Communications
=================================================

This is the base infrastructure for all node communications between services and machines.

We use a P2P communication approach, rather than a Client-Server one because it is more
flexible (for scenarios were it is not clear who is serving who) and are better suited
for work distribution among different nodes on a ever changing and ever growing network.
