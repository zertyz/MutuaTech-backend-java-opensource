Mutua General Purpose Peer-to-Peer Communications
=================================================

This is the base infrastructure for all node communications between services and machines.

We use a P2P communication approach, rather than a Client-Server one because it is more
flexible (for scenarios were it is not clear who is serving who) and are better suited
for work distribution among different nodes on a ever changing and ever growing network.

Versioning
----------
	Each P2PServicesAPI specialization should define a P2PServiceAndVersionId string that
	will be used by peers in order to verify they are able to communicate to one another.

Multiple Service APIs per peer
------------------------------
	When starting the Peer Service, through P2PServicesNode, multiple specializations of
	P2PServicesAPI may be provided, allowing a single peer instance to provide multiple
	services by multiple different modules that, possibly, are unaware of each other.

Multiple Communication Channels
-------------------------------
	The most obvious communication channel is TCP -- although others may be used, like
	a queue -- but, even for TCP, the communication can be done in binary, plain text,
	encrypted, compressed... When using encryption, a good choice could be using the
	application or framework 'VERSION_ID' information, as defined in MutuaICC package.
